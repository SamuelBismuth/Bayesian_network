# Bayesian_network
A repository for the assignment of the course Decision Algorithm

# Project explanation

This project is an implementation of a Bayesian Network in Java.
Three algorithms are implemeted, each algorithm answer to a query of the form : P(A|B,C).
- The first algorithm is simply a prediction using bayes rules.
- The second algorithm is the Variable Elimination Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_elimination).
- The third algorithm is the same that the second algorithm except that the order of the factors is determined such as the complexity of the algorithm should be more efficient.

# Run configuration

To run the program you need a txt file include the bayesian network and the queries as the next:

Network
Variables: B,E,A,J,M

Var B
Values: true, false
Parents: none
CPT:
=true,0.001

Var E
Values: true, false
Parents: none
CPT:
=true,0.002

Var A
Values: true, false
Parents: B,E
CPT:
true,true,=true,0.95
true,false,=true,0.94
false,true,=true,0.29
false,false,=true,0.001

Var J
Values: true, false
Parents: A
CPT:
true,=true,0.9
false,=true,0.05

Var M
Values: true, false
Parents: A
CPT:
true,=true,0.7
false,=true,0.01

Queries
P(B=true|J=true,M=true),1
P(B=true|J=true,M=true),2
P(B=true|J=true,M=true),3
P(J=true|B=true),1
P(J=true|B=true),2

Attention: The spaces, the commas, the line return must be respected.
Please use JAVAC to run the program.
